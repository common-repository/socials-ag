Your social medias in a shortcode.

== Description ==

After installing the plugin. You'll have a new menu in your admin page "AGPlugin".
It will have 2 different parts "follow" (who link to your social page) and "share" (to share the page).

- share: select the social media where your visitors can share the page.
- follow: add the URL to your social media to activate it.

You just have to use the shortcode in your theme to display them:
- share shortcode is: [share-nav]
- follow shortcode is: [follow-nav]

Enjoy !
